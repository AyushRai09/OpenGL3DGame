Welcome to  my own version of BLOXORZ!!!!

Objective
The objective of the game is to make the cuboid slide through the hole. This includes moving your block in correct orientations and by right amount in the minimum number of moves. There are two levels in the game. Completing level one gives you access to level two.Black hole is where you have to slide through. Blue tile is a switch which opens the bridge only when you are standing over it on one face only. Yellow tiles are the flat tiles on which you can lay on while lying on two faces but not with one. Dark green tiles are the bridge tiles.
